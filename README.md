A thorough system analysis should ensure that the end-users needs are met. Gathering feedback from previous users and modifying the code is essential. Identifying specific inputs and outputs for the system is crucial. User stories, which are often used in Agile development, can help express user needs. Doing so makes the end user's perspective understood, resulting in a simplified requirement description. Different project management strategies exist, such as Waterfall, iterative, prototype, agile, and incremental. Agile processes such as Crystal, Scrum, and Extreme Programming are popular and offer unique ways to work with testing, planning, and integration. It's essential to adhere to team standards and project styles in coding and design processes. A sense of progress should be maintained within the team, considering all aspects of the project development. It's essential to react in a friendly manner and take responsibility for one's actions.
